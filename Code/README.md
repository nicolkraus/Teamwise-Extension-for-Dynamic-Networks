# TEAMWISE

TEAMWISE stands for **T**ool for **E**xploration and **A**nalysis of **M**ovement data **W**ithin **I**mmersive **S**ynchronised **E**nvironments. It's an open source, web-based stand-alone application that allows researchers to load local geo-temporal data either from the local file system or from the Movebank database (movebank.org). The data can then be explored and analysed in an intuitive way, allowing for multiple synchronised views.
