# Fonts

We currently self-host two fonts.

## Open Sans
This font has been downloaded via the [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com) that has been provided by Mario Ranftl. We should acknowledge that. The font itself is licensed under **Apache 2.0**, see [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).

## Google Material Icon Font
This font is a nice and easy way to iclude Googles material design icons without having to load or host each icon itself - they are rather included by choosing this font style and use specific hexadecimal codes.

The icon font is also [licensed](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) under Apache 2.0 and was directly downloaded from the respective [github repository](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/iconfont).

# W3.css
No license at all, but we should acknowledge it anyway!
